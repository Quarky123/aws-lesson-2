    "You're currently a data scientist working at a university. A professor of psychology is attempting to study the relationship between personalities and left-handedness. They have tasked you with gathering evidence so that they may publish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the professor says \"I need to prove that left-handedness is caused by some personality trait. Go find that personality trait and the data to back it up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, you know that any real data science problem must be **specific** and **conclusively answerable**. For example:\n",
    "- Bad data science problem: \"What is the link between obesity and blood pressure?\"\n",
    "    - This is vague and is not conclusively answerable. That is, two people might look at the conclusion and one may say \"Sure, the problem has been answered!\" and the other may say \"The problem has not yet been answered.\"\n",
    "- Good data science problem: \"Does an association exist between obesity and blood pressure?\"\n",
    "    - This is more specific and is conclusively answerable. The problem specifically is asking for a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer. Based on that, two independent people should both be able to say either \"Yes, the problem has been answered\" or \"No, the problem has not yet been answered.\"\n",
    "- Excellent data science problem: \"As obesity increases, how does blood pressure change?\"\n",
    "    - This is very specific and is conclusively answerable. The problem specifically seeks to understand the effect of one variable on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. In the context of the left-handedness and personality example, what are three specific and conclusively answerable problems that you could answer using data science? \n",

    "2. If the survey is not optional already, make it optional. If we're only including surveys that are complete, we should allow for people to complete only certain questions instead of making all questions required.\n",
    "3. We should collect this data anonymously, *not* confidentially.\n",
    "    - Anonymously means we do not collect personally identifiable information (PII).\n",
    "    - Confidential means we collect PII but we don't make that available to others.\n",
    "    - If we have access to names or social security numbers, it means that someone could hack us and connect names/SSNs with gender, orientation, etc. Instead, we should collect the data without names or anything so that even if our data are hacked, it is much harder to connect responses with an individual.\n",
    "4. From the perspective of inclusivity, we want to make sure our responses fit everyone trying to respond. For example, for the `gender` category, we should **at minimum** have a male, female, and other category. However, we might consider including options for transgender individuals, having only a fill-in-the-blank response instead of explicit choices, and/or having \"prefer to not answer\" category.\n",
    "5. For a particularly advanced option, there's an area of study called [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) that allows us to study population-level effects without exposing any individual. Consider the following example:\n",
    "    - Have each respondent flip a coin.\n",
    "    - If the respondent flips heads, have them answer the \"gender\" question honestly.\n",
    "    - If the respondent flips tails, have them answer the \"gender\" question with \"transgender.\"\n",
    "        - This way, an individual who answers \"transgender\" may or may not actually be transgender. Someone who hacks the data would never be able to know who truly identifies as transgender versus who identifies as transgender based on the coin flip. However, because we know approximately how many coin flips should be heads versus tails, we can estimate the percentage of individuals who are transgender. This allows us to study what we want to study but also allows us to maintain privacy for individuals!"

The $p$-value is significant at the most common significance levels, but it's also possible that this is just noise. (By testing 44 different questions, it's likely that at least a handful would seem significant just by random chance.)"
